To do this, I used a temperature sensitive E. coli strain, JFL101. At 30 degrees, this strain behaves wild type. At 42 degrees, the Z ring disassembles. This disassembly happens within a minute and can be triggered with a rapid temperature shift. </p> <h3>Experimental Setup</h3> <p> For this experiment, I grew cells at 30 degrees. I then diluted the cells into a 42 degree water bath. I immediately took out an aliquot and fixed the cells in a formaldehyde/glutaraldehyde solution. This almost instantly halts growth and preserves the outer membrane. I repeated this fixation over time to obtain a pseudo time-course. For this part of the project, I observed what happened to the outer membrane in the sudden absence of a Z ring by staining the outer membrane with FM4-64 dye for imaging. </p> <h3>Imaging the Cells</h3> <p> I imaged the fixed and stained cells with both scanning confocal and Stimulated Emission Depletion super-resolution imaging (STED). I used the Leica DMi8 motorized inverted microscope with the Duke Light Core Facility. </p> <h3>Image Segmentation</h3> <p> To analyze the membrane constrictions, I first needed to segment the images for individual instances of cells. Because I imaged thousands of cells, I decided to train the StarDist algorithm to detect these cells. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03535">StarDist</a> is a convolutional neural network specifically designed to detect cells. It is built with TensorFlow in Python by Uwe Schmidt, Martin Weigert, Coleman Broaddus and Gene Myers. I referenced the <a href="https://github.com/HenriquesLab/DeepBacs/wiki/Segmentation">DeepBacs wiki and Colab notebooks</a> by the Henriques Lab extensively to learn and implement this method. </p> <p> I first trained the algorithm to detect these specific cells with both imaging techniques. Even though my raw images were 3D stacks, I flattened these into 2D images for the segmentation portion. This significantly improved the ability of the algorithm to learn as compared to StarDist3D. </p> </div> <div class="footer"> <p style="font-size: medium;"> <a href="../index.html"><button class="fit">Home</button></a> </p> <p> <a href="https://github.com/laurcor55"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> <a href="https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/lcc33"><i class="fa fa-gitlab"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-corbin-goodman-ab6aa752/"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a> <a href="mailto:lcc33@duke.edu"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></a> </p> </div> </body> </html>
