      <h2>Learning Git Collaboration with Ruby Gosu App</h2>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        I wanted to learn how to use Git to collaborate with other developers. As a BME student, we used Git for group projects, but it wasn't as rigorous as needed in industry. To learn collaboration with Git, I built a little Gosu app in Ruby with johnmgoodman.
      </p>
      <p>
        johnmgoodman set up the app's overall architecture. From there, we individually would create a new branch, add some new aspect, and then merge it on Github with a pull request.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Sailor Game</h3>
      <p>Here is a screenshot of the little app we made. It has a scared school of fish, a zippy row boat, and tretcherous waves.</p>
