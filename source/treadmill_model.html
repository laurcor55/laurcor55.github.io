      <h2>FtsZ Treadmill Model</h2>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        FtsZ is a bacterial cell division protein. It lines up head to tail to form single stranded protofilaments (PFs). These PFs gather at the mid cell to produce the Z ring. The Z ring constricts to divide the cell into two daughter cells.

      <p>
        Over the past two decades, it has become increasingly clear that FtsZ treadmills. Treadmilling is when subunits primarily add to one side and subtract from the other side of a PF. This produces an overall net movement of the PF, but individual subunits remain in place.

      <p>
        It was not immediately clear how a single stranded PF could attain such polarity to directionally treadmill. I developed a computational model that showed that directional treadmilling can be obtained with 1) a conformational switch within individual FtsZ subunits and 2) stochastic GTP hydrolysis. Furthermore, nucleation of new PFs can also be explained with this conformational switch.
