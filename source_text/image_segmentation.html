      <h2>Image Segmentation</h2>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        This is a continuation of my work with <a href="flow_cytometry.html">precise cell enumeration with flow cytometry.</a> Here is the summary again.
      </p>
      <p>
        We wanted to see if an E. coli cell could complete division without a fully assembled Z ring. To do this, I used a temperature sensitive E. coli strain, JFL101. At 30 degrees, this strain behaves wild type. At 42 degrees, the Z ring disassembles. This disassembly happens within a minute and can be triggered with a rapid temperature shift. 
      </p>
      <h3>Experimental Setup</h3>
      <p>
        For this experiment, I grew cells at 30 degrees. I then diluted the cells into a 42 degree water bath. I immediately took out an aliquot and fixed the cells in a formaldehyde/glutaraldehyde solution. This almost instantly halts growth and preserves the outer membrane. I repeated this fixation over time to obtain a pseudo time-course. For this part of the project, I observed what happened to the outer membrane in the sudden absence of a Z ring by staining the outer membrane with FM4-64 dye for imaging. 
      </p>
      
      <h3>Imaging the Cells</h3>
      <p>
        I imaged the fixed and stained cells with both scanning confocal and Stimulated Emission Depletion super-resolution imaging (STED). I used the Leica DMi8 motorized inverted microscope with the Duke Light Core Facility.
      </p>
      <h3>Image Segmentation</h3>
      <p>
        To analyze the membrane constrictions, I first needed to segment the images for individual instances of cells. Because I imaged thousands of cells, I decided to train the StarDist algorithm to detect these cells. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03535">StarDist</a> is a convolutional neural network specifically designed to detect cells. It is built with TensorFlow in Python by Uwe Schmidt, Martin Weigert, Coleman Broaddus and Gene Myers. I referenced the <a href="https://github.com/HenriquesLab/DeepBacs/wiki/Segmentation">DeepBacs wiki and Colab notebooks</a> by the Henriques Lab extensively to learn and implement this method.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first trained the algorithm to detect these specific cells with both imaging techniques. Even though my raw images were 3D stacks, I flattened these into 2D images for the segmentation portion. This significantly improved the ability of the algorithm to learn as compared to StarDist3D.
