      <h2>Identifying Clouds with CNN and Pytorch</h2>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        A while ago, I wanted to learn how to identify clouds. Clouds are classified similar to living beings, with a genus and species. I memorized the cloud types, but when I took quizzes, I did poorly. Perhaps I could just teach my computer to do this work for me. My goal was to implement several image classification algorithms on a cloud image dataset.
      </p>
      
      
      <h3>Dataset</h3>
      <p>I needed a labeled dataset of clouds as viewed from the ground. There are several datasets that contain clouds viewed from satellites, but I only found one dataset with clouds viewed from the ground, the <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CADDPD"> Cirrus Cumulus Stratus Nimbus (CCSN) database.</a> This dataset is messy. Most of the images are wrongly labeled, so I had to check all the labels. Because I am bad at clouds, I only kept the images that were obvious. This resulted in a tiny dataset of about 500 images, the perfect challenge.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>Note that this dataset is for my enjoyment, not for actual cloud identification. I took lots of liberties with labelling. I combined a few genera because I couldn't tell the difference between them, and I got rid of a few others. Several labels might be wrong, but they look good to me and that's what matters for this. Here is the genera reference. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>AcCc - Altocumulus or Cirrocumulus (looks the same to me), bubble clouds high in the sky</li>
        <li>Cb - Cumulonimbus, huge clouds with defined edges</li>
        <li>Ci - Cirrus, wispy guys</li>
        <li>Ct - Contrails (or Chemtrails if you're American), lines made from planes</li>
        <li>Cu - Cumulus, low bubble clouds</li>
        <li>NsCs - Nimbostratus or Cirrostratus, thick haze. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Implementation of Classification Algorithms</h3>
      <h4>Convolutional Neural Network</h4>
      <p>I implemented the AlexNet CNN algorithm in PyTorch. <a href="https://github.com/laurcor55/cloud-identifier/blob/main/cnn.py">The code is on GitHub</a>. To compensate for my small dataset, I augmented the data with a random horizontal flip and a small random rotation. I added 50% dropout in the fully connected layers to avoid over fitting. I used a batch size of 100 and 50 epochs.</p>

      <p>I achieved 76% accuracy with the validation dataset. </p>

      <h4>Multilayer Perceptron</h4>
      <p>The MLP code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/laurcor55/cloud-identifier/blob/main/mlp.py">GitHub.</a> For the MLP, I used two hidden layers with Leaky ReLU activation functions. I chose a Leaky ReLU because it seemed like the neurons were dying off with the ReLU. The ReLU sped up the training. I got 52% accuracy with this approach. </p>

      <h4>Conclusions</h4>
      <p>I could play with this dataset indefinitely. I enjoy the puzzles that imperfect datasets present.</p>
